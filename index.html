            <p><strong>Password Manager:</strong> This project was inspired by the need for privacy, helping me understand encryption and Python better through practical experience. I used Tkinter for the GUI and learned encryption through cryptography/fernet. It was a fun project, and while the design isn't perfect, the functionality is solid!</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>WebNotes:</strong> This was a small project I used as a stepping stone to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It served as a note-taking tool during my time in school.</p>
